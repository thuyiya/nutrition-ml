Step 1 - calculate calories per recommendation (12.5% snacks/pre-snacks/post-snacks and remainder split evenly in meals/pre-meals),,,,,,,,,,,

"Step 2 - calculate pre-snacks, pre-meals, and post-snacks if there are any as per A6:I18 MEAL TYPE <> EXERCISE TYPE <> INTENSITY MAP (days with no practices get distribution of 12.5% snacks and the rest evenly on meals)",,,,,,,,,,,
