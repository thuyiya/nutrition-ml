Meal Type,CALORIES %,MACROS RULES,,,,Rules we currently have,,,,,,,
Breakfast,25%,"Follow the g/kg rule based on time to exercise, intensity of exercise, and whether power or endurance",,,,First correction method- add a snack that equals the number of calories missed up to 12.5% Post-Workout Snack,,,,,,,
Pre Snack,12.50%,For meals within the exercise window use the macro rules to calculate exact amount needed. Distribute remaining macros at 2:1 ratio Meal:Snack,,,,"If calories needed are still above that number, then start distributing them between the remaining meals; we will provide a rule for a cap",,,,,,,
Post Snack,12.50%,,,,,"COMES IN AT 2 HOURS BEFORE LOWER CARB, LOWER PROTEIN, LOWER CALORIE=15%",,,,,,,
Lunch,25%,,,,,,,,,,,,
Add a snack,up to 12.5% (make up calories),,,,,,,,,,,,
Dinner,25%,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 HOUR PRE MEAL,15%,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,Miss breakfast - down 625 cals,,,,,,,
,,,,,,Add 1 snack at 12.5% - replaces 312 calories,,,,,,,
Question,App Action,,Scenario examples,,,Add 5% of total cals (2500 * .05 = 125) to each meal (lunch and dinner) -- replaces 250 calories,,,,,,,
What is an approximate range of calories and macros to be below or above in meals presented in reccommendation?,App will present meals that are within this range,,,,,Net down 63 calories,,,,,,,
When should the correction to calories start to happen?,If user has logged a meal that has missed the specified range than start correcting,"If user misses calories by more than 250, start adding evenly to future meals. If miss by over 250, App adds snack up to 12.5% of total calories",,,,,,,,,,,
"What is the rule for macronutrient range that should lead to increase outside the 6 hour window (assume we wont change the pre and post recs, but what if such a bad meal early). The App should work hand in hand here with calories, correct?",,"Rule that 1. if miss calories by +/-xyz range, make the change by adding snack or decreasing meals up to certain amount; 2. If miss macro goals by xyz range, add a snack rec with increase in calorie by xyz amount, or add a snack that fits the macro goal + calorie deficit","Overconsumed a ton of protein and underconsumed on calories, app should look to address the issue in last meals by adding snack that shows calorie needs decreasing protein by a standard rule. If don't have that option then we can say we dont have a meal for this","Maybe if miss a macro range again up to a certain level, we reccomend a snack up to calorie range acceptable over their goal? If they miss a calorie goal too then we reccommend the combo of protein and snack?",,,,,,,,,
What is the cap of calories and macros to increase by?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What do we do if no meal options can get that high or low? What if we can get lower or higher in calories or in macros but not fulfill both, ie. What is a safe suggestion here- show closest meals to this situation in range of x calories and y macros?","Should we add a snack option to meal options to get closer to calorie and macro needs if no meals can meet this demand, or just suggest meals that will get close enough and then suggest use Create Custom Meal. ""Use custom meal and snack generator to help you get a few more macros and calories here"" (message shows only if not logged within accepted range)",,"App suggests meals, shows how far short and suggests using create meal",,,,,,,,,,

,"Based on meal logging, otherwise follow basline calculated routine",,,,,,,,,,,,
,CALORIES,MACROS,,,,,,,,,,,
UNDERCONSUMPTION,"1. Distribute any missed calories evenly across all meals, up until 12.5% total calories. At this point, it will lead to a snack added containing the macros needed to be made up. We will only add or subtract up to 5% total calories of all meals and snacks. Anything over 25% goes to 2 snacks","Distribute Calories first, then macros","increase total calories and macros evenly, up to 5%.",,,,,,,,,,
OVERCONSUMPTION,1. Reduce any missed calories evenly across all meals but will only add or subtract up to 5% of all meals and snacks. ,"Distribute Calories First, then macros",,,,,,,,,,,
