,CALCULATION,OUTPUT,When to use:,WHAT IS THE RESULT OF THIS
Step 1: ,"Complete RMR Equation (Harris Benedict, Cunningham) ",,,
Basic Cal Needs,"Male HB Equation (height, weight, age) ",66.473+(13.7516*wt in kg)+(5.0033*ht in cm)-(6.755*age),"all males with ht, wt, age",basic calorie needs if they were to do no exercise at all
,"Female HB Equation (weight, weight, age)",655.0955+(9.5634*wt in kg)+(1.8496*ht in cm)-(4.6756*age),"all females with ht, wt, age",basic calorie needs if they were to do no exercise at all
,,,,basic calorie needs if they were to do no exercise at all
,Male/Female Cunningham equation ,(500)+(22*Lean Body Mass in kg),"if a male or female enters a body fat %, the app will have to calculate thier lean body mass (150# with 20% body fat 120#/2.2 = 55kg of lean body mass) and use this equation IN ADDITION TO the one in step 1 and average them ",basic calorie needs if they were to do no exercise at all
,,,,
Step 2:,Activity Factor ,,Body Mass = 150# ,
Total Daily Calories,Sedentary (little or no exercise),1.2,Body Fat % = 18%,calorie needs based on above # + activity 
,Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week),1.4,Fat Mass = 150*.18 = 27# Fat,
,Moderately active (moderate exercise 3-5 days/week),1.6,Lean Body Mass = 150-27 = 123#/2.2 =56 LBM in kg,
,Very Active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/week),1.75,(500) + (22*56kg) ,
,Extra activity (hard exercise + physical job or 2x/day training),1.9,,
